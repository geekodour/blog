      <description>This is just to note down my ideas about current problems in the Indian education system. This is not exhaustime and will always keep growing. I hope it shrinks someday.
There can be another blogpost on what I think the ideal Indian education system would look like. I am not knowlegable enough to write something like that but as I collect enough sharable information and ideas I&amp;rsquo;ll write one post on it someday, eventually.</description>

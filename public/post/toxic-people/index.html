<p>&ldquo;Negative people can only infest you with discouragements when they find you around&hellip; Just get lost and get saved!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hate toxic people, I feel bad that this is my second post about these people on my personal blog.
You know, it gets worse when these people are your own family members who you suppose to be family.</p>

<p>Not able to concentrate on things when slightly disturbed/angered is something I&rsquo;ve to come over. Right now I cannot,
so writing this blog is just a coping mechanism.</p>

<p>I have so many issues I want to talk about, I am not in the best state of mind. Especially if I get called out
everytime I see my family. Even though they don&rsquo;t speak about it, their eyes and their vibes are equally harmful.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like being around these people. I love my family but if they cannot support me, atleast they should
not bring me down as a person making me feel bad about myself just because they don&rsquo;t believe in what I do or
what I am trying to do. It certainly isn&rsquo;t conventional.</p>

<p>I wish I could write things more beautifully, guess I just have to read more mind expanding books and think more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve a long month of July infront of me. It will be hard. Systems and Databases along with few other important subjects.</p>

<p>I can only stay silent and work hard and then speakup for myself years later or never. I hate toxic people.</p>

<p>I need to stay positive, I cannot think positive. Infact to be honest I am the person who first thinks things
that could go wrong instead of good. I always have the wrong prespective and for me it&rsquo;s most of time true.
It&rsquo;s hard for me to explain because I still have not figured myself out yet.</p>

<p>I guess this is what life is. yeah. People mess their own life, are unhappy with their own life and then put the
anger on me for nothing.</p>

<p>Is family bullying a thing? It should be.</p>

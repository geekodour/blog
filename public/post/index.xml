      <description>This is just for personal future reference:
There is a family of exec() library functions, all of which have slightly different characteristics:
int execl ( const char *path, const char *arg, ... ); int execlp( const char *file, const char *arg, ... ); int execle( const char *path, const char *arg, ..., char *const envp[] ); int execv ( const char *path, char *const argv[] ); int execvp( const char *file, char *const argv[] ); int execvpe(const char *file, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);   if p in the name: accepts a program name and it searches for the program in $PATH env var if l or v in the name: the program name must be given in full(path).</description>

      <description>I am trying to learn ansible and I got quite frustrated at how long(15s) is it taking for my ubuntu vm to ssh into my centos vm. So to know why is it taking so i used ssh vagrant@ip_addr -vvv to print things in debug mode.
The debug messages were these (trimmed ofc)
debug1: Unspecified GSS failure. Minor code may provide more information No Kerberos credentials available debug1: Unspecified GSS failure.</description>

      <description>This is an approach that can be done, I don&amp;rsquo;t follow it yet but will fedenitely try it. Also, this post is not about how to learn new technology.
For example you want to start learning redis or maybe netfilter,
These softwares have their conferences, as you learn you can also apply for these</description>

      <title>Character encoding bits</title>

      <description>So I was just hanging around a discord group when someone asked this:
 What&amp;rsquo;s the minimum number of bits I can use to encode an arbitrary ASCII string 8 characters long that only contains capital letters and numbers? I&amp;rsquo;m coming up with 42, but that seems like too many. Maybe my intuition for this is just wrong
 So how did he come up with 42?
He&amp;rsquo;s basically asking he as a set of 36 possibilities for a character (26+10) and the length of the string he wants to fit those characters in is 8 characters long.</description>

      <description>This is just to note down my ideas about current problems in the Indian education system. This is not exhaustime and will always keep growing. I hope it shrinks someday.
There can be another blogpost on what I think the ideal Indian education system would look like. I am not knowlegable enough to write something like that but as I collect enough sharable information and ideas I&amp;rsquo;ll write one post on it someday, eventually.</description>

      <guid>/post/building-a-bot-to-post-instagram-stories-automatically-to-my-blog/</guid>
      <description>TLDR; Made a bot that posts selected instagram stories automatically to my blog.
Source Code is here if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for that.
I love instagram. I like posting stories and memes there and yesteday night I felt the urgency(ironical) to post about education on my story.
I wrote a moderately long post in a story with small text. I realized this should&amp;rsquo;ve been a blogpost aswell but I already posted the story and to get the text back I&amp;rsquo;ve to do OCR on it.</description>

      <description>So you have a branch with few commits and you want to squash all of them into one before sending a PR to your favorite opensource project.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it.
First do,
$ git log  Scroll till you reach the upstream or origin branch commit where the current branch was branched from. Then just copy the commitid of that commit. If you branched it from the master then it will either be (upstream/master, master) or (origin/master, master) i.</description>

      <guid>/post/how-i-am-planning-to-make-my-meme-and-music-bots/</guid>
      <description>So i want this to be a hack, it does not matter if other people will be able to use it(should be able to though) but it should somehow work for me.
Github gives unlimited storage, so all images will be uploaded to the blog github repo.
Meme bot for video and images Use hosts file to make url short for heroku app. There will be a simple webapp where you can just put links.</description>

      <description>So, welcome to my blog! This is probably my 5th or 6th blog but I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about 4-6 hours making this one. So this one probably will fly off. Let&amp;rsquo;s see.
Also, will be blogging regularly but not daily ofcourse.
c
printf(&amp;quot;Hello World!&amp;quot;);  python
print(Hello World!)  works.
nice.

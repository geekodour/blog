      <description>I am going off social media and my phone for about one month now. If I like it I&amp;rsquo;ll probably increase it even more. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about anything else. i am very depressed because my sister told me something that hurt me very much. I only get hurt when people i care about say bad things about me. I love my family and friends but I rather not live than to keep disappointing thjem over and over again, I cried about 5 hoursd lat night i am still crying,.</description>

      <description>TLDR; Made a bot that posts selected instagram stories automatically to my blog.
Source Code is here if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for that.
I love instagram. I like posting stories and memes there and yesteday night I felt the urgency(ironical) to post about education on my story.
I wrote a moderately long post in a story with small text. I realized this should&amp;rsquo;ve been a blogpost aswell but I already posted the story and to get the text back I&amp;rsquo;ve to do OCR on it.</description>

      <description>So you have a branch with few commits and you want to squash all of them into one before sending a PR to your favorite opensource project.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it.
First do,
$ git log  Scroll till you reach the upstream or origin branch commit where the current branch was branched from. Then just copy the commitid of that commit. If you branched it from the master then it will either be (upstream/master, master) or (origin/master, master) i.</description>

      <title>How I am planning to make my Meme and Music bots</title>

      <description>So i want this to be a hack, it does not matter if other people will be able to use it(should be able to though) but it should somehow work for me.
Github gives unlimited storage, so all images will be uploaded to the blog github repo.
Meme bot for video and images Use hosts file to make url short for heroku app. There will be a simple webapp where you can just put links.</description>

      <description>So, welcome to my blog! This is probably my 5th or 6th blog but I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about 4-6 hours making this one. So this one probably will fly off. Let&amp;rsquo;s see.
Also, will be blogging regularly but not daily ofcourse.
c
printf(&amp;quot;Hello World!&amp;quot;);  python
print(Hello World!)  works.
nice.
./Lots of love &amp;lt;3</description>

# Hello

### Welcome to my little corner on the interweb.

I believe that memes and good education have the power to make the world a better place.

About me, I live in Guwahati, Assam and currently completing my B.Tech here.
I've always enjoyed

It all started with this when I was in 8th standard:
```c
prinf("Hello World!");
```
Afterwards I got hookedup into computer networking

I have a favorite memes page and favorite music page on this blog too!

A computer at least had some sort of physical reality to it. It came in a box, you could open it up and plug it in and watch lights blink. An operating system had no tangible incarnation at all. It arrived on a disk, of course, but the disk was, in effect, nothing more than the box that the OS came in.

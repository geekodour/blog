# Hello

### Welcome to my little corner on the interweb.

I am Hrishikesh, currently doing my undergrad from GIMT Guwahati

```c
printf("Hello!");
```
My GPG Key: &*jhgdhgashgd67565ashdghgd

A computer at least had some sort of physical reality to it. It came in a box, you could open it up and plug it in and watch lights blink. An operating system had no tangible incarnation at all. It arrived on a disk, of course, but the disk was, in effect, nothing more than the box that the OS came in.

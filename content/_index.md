# Hello earthling,

### Welcome to my little corner on the interweb.

*"Everything is possible when you're dead from inside" - [Rishi Giri](https://github.com/CodeDotJS)*

About [me](/img/me.jpg), I live in [Guwahati](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Guwahati_City.jpg/411px-Guwahati_City.jpg), India and currently a 3rd year [computer science](/img/compsci.png) student at [GIMT Guwahati](/img/college.jpg).

There are two things I really care about, **improving the education system in India** and **technology for a cause**.

I don't [call myself a programmer](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) but I like solving problems and use my programming abilities as a tool.

I think a lot about following best practices, **free software** and having a clean and documented codebase and I try to learn something new every single day. I am a big fan of selfhosting things. I also have a [wiki](https://wiki.geekodour.xyz)!

I'm interested in **systems and network programming**, **distributed systems**, **p2p networks** and how we can use technology to move our society in the right direction.

# Hello earthling,

### Welcome to my little corner on the interweb.

*"Everything is possible when you're dead from inside - [Rishi Giri](https://github.com/CodeDotJS)"*

About [me](/img/me.jpg), I live in [Guwahati](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Guwahati_City.jpg/411px-Guwahati_City.jpg), Assam and currently a 3rd year [computer science](/img/compsci.png) student at [GIMT Guwahati](/img/weed.png).
I also majored in [Netflix](/img/netflix.jpg), masters in [debugging](/img/debug.jpg). joke haha.

> *Fun fact: I can lucid dream on demand.*

There are two things I really care about, **improving the education system in India** and **technology for a cause**.

I started programming in C when I was in 8th standard, a year later I got hookedup into computer networks and got back to programming in the 1st year of college.
I did a lot of [freelance](/img/freelance.jpg) work with **web development** and **systems admin** related tasks for the first two years in college.

I am passionate about efficient programming, following best practices, **open source** and having a clean and documented codebase and I try to learn something new every single day.

I'm fascinated with **systems and network programming**, **distributed systems**, **streaming**, and how we can use technology to move our society in the right direction.

I wish to work at google someday as a SRE but that day is probably in next 10 years or not in this lifetime.

I have a [favorite memes](#) and [favorite music](#) page on this blog too!

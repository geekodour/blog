So i want this to be a hack, it does not matter if other people will be able to use it(should be able to though)
but it should somehow work for me.

~~Github gives unlimited storage, so all images will be uploaded to the blog github repo.~~

### Meme bot for video and images
Use hosts file to make url short for heroku app.
There will be a simple webapp where you can just put links.
backend should extract and upload images and videos to my fake google drive storage.

- should pull all images saved in reddit with `/4chan` or from `/me_irl`
- Have a upload button to upload current photos

### Youtube and Soundcloud
This is fairly simple, just put the api keys in the server and put out a api endpoint to names of all music.


Will do this soon.

> Archive post from my newsletter. letter #1

Dear reader,

This is my first letter from my newsletter [indication](https://tinyletter.com/indication). I created this newsletter a year ago, but never felt ready enough to send out a letter. Waiting for the perfect moment can wait now. ;)

This is my newsletter and not my twitter, so I'll blast my subjective perceptions to space here. (that's the nicest word I could find for my shitty opinions), I am also bad at writing and known for making a lot of grammatical  mistakes, I no longer make spelling mistakes, thanks to the pointy red lines. So consider this my scratchpad for writing as well.

It breaks my heart that I was not able to gather some data to back my views at the moment, but here goes nothing.

This particular letter will give rough description of a question and offers no solution to the question, just will beat the bush around the question. The question is:

> "Does college matter in 2019?"

Before I even start on anything, I'd like to quote what I currently assume education to be, so that the rest of the text makes better sense:

> It is something that teaches us how to live life better. It can come to us from anything, even from our dreams.

Stupid thoughts lead to more useful thoughts, so I tend to think deeper into stupid thoughts sometimes. So it occurred to me recently, that we should teach a subject called "Life" at schools, this subject will include case studies of different humans from different generations describing how they dealt with different situations so that we know what to do if we find ourselves in their place. But this is essentially a "How can I use X to do Y?".

> If what you want is to do Y, you should ask that question without pre-supposing the use of a method that may not be appropriate. Questions of this form often indicate a person who is not merely ignorant about X, but confused about what problem Y they are solving and too fixated on the details of their particular situation. It is generally best to ignore such people until they define their problem better. [1]

But it helped me understand that it's the bigger goal, we just cannot be including here's how to live life in a single subject. Schools or any education institution for that matter cannot teach you or prepare you for your uncertain future. We just keep learning, either from mistakes or before the mistakes.

Some people say that there's too much education today but maybe skipping some of it will be unfair for a student who was interested in learning something. Some schools include some subject and some skip the same subject if you're lucky the subject you wanted to learn will be taught in your school.

Two more examples to drive this home:

> The person who gets more education gets a better job. It works; you see it plainly. Yet it does not follow that if everyone gets more education, everyone gets a better job. [2]

> Including a subject helped students passing out in 2010, Including that subject in the syllabus with the same content in 2019 makes no sense.

We habitually assume that getting an education is going to enrich our lives. Well, that's true when that's what education does to you and you fail to see what happens when it does not help you. There are things in the wild labeled as education which does not seem to do so or at least fail to do so. When it fails, students feel like saying "*I am unlucky, had I been in better institution things would have been much better.*"

Being lucky in education for me at least has nothing to do with being rich or going to a good school. It means you got to study the things that were right for you, the things you wanted to study, you did the thing you wanted to do, that's all is in getting lucky in education. I am not even talking about climbing up the ladder of success here.

It should not come by surprise that some people had a pretty good education despite the fact that they come from schools where the education is known to be bad, does it mean they were lucky? From my definition of lucky, yes. Somewhere along the lines, they picked up ways to learn the things they wanted to learn, the things that are right for them.

So to be lucky in education, you just need to figure out a way to learn the thing you wanted to learn. Well, that makes it easy to think about at least. ;)

In a recent discussion with someone I greatly admire, he mentioned that this is the best time to be alive and citing your education institution for you not being able to do something is just being lazy, putting it another way,

I don't have enough information to answer the question "Does college matter in 2019" yet, but I'll let you know if I ever figure that out!

Do you think college matter? let me know by replying to this mail.
Also please don't hesitate to point out my mistake or tell me that I am wrong.

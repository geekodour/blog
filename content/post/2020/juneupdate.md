We all know how tough this year has been for everyone on planet earth, as a non-ignorant denizen I had though all that as well but just like everyone else, I have my own personal problems some of which I'd like to discuss briefly.

## Guilt
My dad passed away last year with Alzheimer's, I was never close to dad and I remember me talking to dad for hours trying to figure out why was he crying at age 65. I didn't know depression is a thing back then. I love my family but I never could express my love for my family whatsoever. I think I'll carry this guilt all my life.

There are so many other guilts I constantly live with that I do not want to discuss them publicly.

## Calling for help
I cannot call for help directly, I decided to save some from my GSoC money to go see a therapist I went for 5-6 session which was very expensive but it did not help a bit. She later spammed me of her Instagram live session on my WhatsApp, I ended up blocking my therapist.

## Blind Eye
Happiness is a myth. You cannot be happy, at least on this planet unless you do the blind eye because there are so many wrong things happening all around. I decided not to be happy about anything that happens to me and value good things less because there's something bad happening somewhere whether I like it or not. I cannot be happy because I am not good at doing the blind eye. I like drinking beer and smoking a cig sometimes.

## Humans
Communication is the greatest technology ever invented. Transferring information from one place to another, I have thing strong belief that we are just a different breed of computers and just I like to reverse engineer humans. It's not easy and beyond my understanding but I like thinking about it.

## Books
I refrained from reading books till I was 23 because I wanted to think and form my own ideas about the world rather than someone else telling me how the world works. I know it's stupid for some, but let me be. please.

## Good things
I have a good life, I recently got a job offer at a very nice place. I have good friends but these are the things that one can see from the outside. From the inside, I am very broken and I don't understand myself. I just want to see other people if not for my family, I am ready to devote my entire life to help someone. I don't care about how much money I make or what other people think of me(this does give me a lot of anxiety) but I really don't care I am just going to live another 30-40 years and then I die. My life has no value, you might.

Dogs and cats and a few good people in my life make me happy. I am just tired of this world, I keep on telling myself that I'll keep on walking till I find a way to help someone or something and that is all that matters.

I like giving things away, I hate doing technical support esp. how to setup linux. I like helping but not that kind.

## Opensource
I am thankful to opensource for saving my life.

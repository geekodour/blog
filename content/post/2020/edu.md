# what has changed since i wrote that post almost 5 years ago?

# Why our education system sucks

This post should have been about the traditional education system that I am so sick and tired of, I have been delaying that post for so long that I should be jailed for it but nevertheless the world continues to disappoint me in the same way I continue to disappoint the world. In tonights edition of why educatio in bharat sucks, let's discuss about BYJU'S and Unacademy. Oh yeah, include whitehtjr there aswell.

I mean I did not want to call out these companies like that, I just wanted to use an example of companies similar to these but these are just super popular. That's what you get for being so popular; Get ranted on geekodour's blog that nobody ever reads.

So as you might have guessed this is about online education and the monopoly of the online education gaints in India. About COVID ofc, the issues traditional teachers are facing etc.

## i am tired of whatever is going on

Let me summarize twitter in a nutshell.

> You should read: https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/ if you really want to understand what's going on.

But let me summarize. The notion of casting twitter as a learning resource is total bullshit(okay not total). I used to be furious at someone who posted something which basically stated that humans can't be learning resources because they have opinions attached to what they give out. Because I believed that everything is political and it was stupid to think that things that would work in the real world taught

Take opensource for example, people who say that opensource is apolitical don't know what they are talking about because the idea of opensource in itself is political. It's about how we should use and distribute software that is used by almost everyone on the planet at the moment. If that's not political idk what is. Does this mean opensource is not a learning resource because it is political and has opinions it it? we'll see.

I hated that idea `(things containing opininon != learning resource)` so much that I built a project around it https://github.com/geekodour/reachout but i never completed it ofc. (I really need to work on getting shit done thing) anyway, back to education. But things changed over the years for me, now I am not totally onesided. I think some things are worth being political and some things should never be made political and as adults and as educators of the upcoming human generation we share a collective responsibility to give them what they need to "survive and thrive".

So we understand that what we can call a learning resource is fairly complicated question.

Here is a diagram that has some of the popular learning resources that are out there for students willing to work in the area of computer science.

> So in this discussion of education system, why did I bring twitter in the first paragraph?

Well, let me take you back in time to 4 December 2019 when govt of India decided to enact the CAB and almost everyone in my homestate(Assam) went out to the street to protest against it. The people of Assam were protesting because they felt threatened

and I joined twitter to rant and also because there were rumors of internet shutdown(which became very real in a couple of days, I should probably write another post on how I came to know that they don't really care about us and who are "they" that we so often talk about?)

TV ad about sending kids to NASA, how is this different from giving miss calls to v


- As byjus is the only way to learn thing.
- Strong marketing. Don't pull your ugly marketing gimmiks into the education industry.
- Wrong impressions, top 1% go to silicon valley. (I am 23 and it took me 2-4 years to understand that silicon valley is not holy temple, stop protraying it as so to kids)
- Wrong mentoring is worse than no mentoring.
- They need a book
- How


- everyone will tell you that you can learn from the internet but god forbid a student learning from someone who decided that that person should sell a course

- student statistcation != quality of education.

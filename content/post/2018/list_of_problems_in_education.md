This is just to note down my ideas about current problems
in the Indian education system. This is not exhaustime and will always keep growing.
I hope it shrinks someday.

There can be another blogpost on what I think the ideal Indian education system would look like.
I am not knowlegable enough to write something like that but as I collect enough sharable information
and ideas I'll write one post on it someday, eventually.

I'll write another post explaining the possible solutions to these problems.

## List of problems in Education

- Lack of proper mentorship.
- **Students don't trust the board:**
  - Eg. Papers getting leaked for the biggest exam of the nation/year by CBSE
  - Eg. Our college board, it passed a student who didn't give exam and failed*
  a student(me) who wrote 85+ in the final exam.
  - This ends up students being demotivated to study.
- The system cannot provide motivation to study and on top of it demotiovates students.
As pointed out, the education system demotivates students by loosing trust.
students struggle with their issues and manage to gain motivation to study and
sensire students attain some amount of decipliene, this again is destoyed by the system.
- One size fits all happening at too many levels
  - Teaching style
  - Subject topic
  - more.

I am going off social media and my phone for about one month now. If I like it I'll probably increase it even more.
I don't want to talk about anything else. i am very depressed because my sister told me something that hurt me very much.
I only get hurt when people i care about say bad things about me. I love my family and friends but I rather not live than to keep disappointing thjem over and over again, I cried about 5 hoursd lat night i am still crying,. I had suicidal thoughts all the time. 

I just want to be left alone till i don't fix myself. also, I'll paint, work on improving our education system and work becoming a systems and network pro.

./Keep hacking and be happy

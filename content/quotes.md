List of quotes/advice I collected over the internet.

-  *Spending a few days researching the topic always completely changes how I am going to solve it.*
-  *The truth is that programming isn't a passion or a talent, it is just a bunch of skills that can be learned. Programming isn't even one thing, though he had been talking about it as if it were; it requires all sorts of skills and coding is just a small part of that. Things like design, communication, writing, and debugging are needed. Also, "we need to have at least one person who understands Unicode", he said to laughter.*
-  *The most important advice I can share with you, as you're starting out, is that a career is a long road, with many twists and turns along the way. The best way I know of to excel in software is to keep a growth mindset. The more you can learn and improve, the more career options you'll have.*
-  *Every time we do sit down to learn something, we have to make a decision whether to widen our breadth of knowledge, or to dig deeper into something we're already familiar with. Then we have to decide which thing within those two broad categories we're going to tackle.*
-  *What I cannot create, I do not understand. – Richard Feynman*

-  *Knowledge Debt, Being a programmer is about being in a continuous state of learning. Letting knowledge debt accumulate can slowly bring your career and productivity to a halt. If you have a knowledge debt in an area that is essential to your work, you will find that it takes more time and effort to write new features and much, much more time and effort to fixing bugs. The longer you take in returning the debt, the more “time interest” it will cost you.*
-  *Do not confuse motion and progress (man riding a toy horse)*
-  *Reminder that it takes just as much effort (time, money, staff, etc.) to build the wrong thing as it does the right thing. Problem discovery is under appreciated as a practice in software engineering, especially when compared to problem solving.*
- *As soon as you give people a metric they're judged by, they optimize for that metric rather than do quality work.*
- Breakthroughs happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately needed.
